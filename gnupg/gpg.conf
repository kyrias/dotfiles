# when outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:
fixed-list-mode
# short-keyids are trivially spoofed; it's easy to create a long-keyid collision; if you care about strong key identifiers, you always want to see the fingerprint: 
keyid-format 0xlong
#with-fingerprint
# when multiple digests are supported by all recipients, choose the strongest one:
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
# preferences chosen for new keys should prioritize stronger algorithms: 
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 BZIP2 ZLIB ZIP Uncompressed
# You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:
verify-options show-uid-validity
list-options show-uid-validity
# when making an OpenPGP certification, use a stronger digest than the default SHA1:
cert-digest-algo SHA512
